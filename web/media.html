        <div id="application" style="display:none">
          <p>
          <p>We welcome inquiries regarding opportunities in the lab for both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
            at any time.
            Before doing so, you should browse the <a href=../projects>web page
              descriptions</a> of some of our group's current projects, and
            <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/apply>apply to the graduate program</a> in Electrical and
            Computer
            Engineering at McGill University, specifying your interest in working
            with me in Human-Computer Interaction or Computer Vision as part of the
            Intelligent Systems research group.
          </p>

          <p>
            To let me know about your interest, please <a href=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/email.html>email</a> the
            following to my attention:

          <ul>
            <li> Cover letter outlining:</li>
            <ol>
              <li> Why you are interested in joining the lab</li>

          <p>
            Due to the high volume of applications we receive, we are generally limited to responding only to promising
            candidates.</p>

          <p> If you're a scholarship student (or expect to receive an NSERC or
            equivalent) and live within reasaonble proximity to Montreal, please <a
              href=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/email.html>contact me
              directly</a> to arrange a time to visit our lab.</p>

      <li>
        What <a href="#" onclick="$('#qualifications').slideToggle('slow');return false">qualifications</a> do I need to
        become a graduate student in your group?

        <div id="qualifications" style="display:none">
          <p>
            First, you should have excellent grades; the department's
            minimum threshold is a CGPA of 3.0 out of 4 or a GPA of 3.2 out
            of 4.0 for the last two full-time academic years, but in general,
            we accept only students with much stronger records. There are
            TOEFL requirements for non-Canadian applicants (GRE is optional). See the
            <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/graduate/graduate/process>admissions requirements page</a> for details.
            You should also
            posess a solid background (e.g. an undergraduate degree) in Electrical
            and Computer Engineering or Computer Science, have strong programming
            skills in C, Java, Python, or equivalent, and have excellent communication skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            For students wishing to enter the Ph.D. program, you should have
            relevant experience in a core subject area pertinent to the research
            project of interest and ideally, a number of publications.</p>
        </div>
      </li>


      <li>
        What sort of <a href="#" onclick="$('#funding').slideToggle('slow');return false">funding</a> is available to
        support my studies?

        <div id="funding" style="display:none">
          <p>
            We provide funding to a limited number of graduate students every year
            through research grants and contracts. However, other than cases
            where a prospective student already has a scholarship (see below), we
            are unlikely to provide support for M.Sc. students. Qualified
            Canadian applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for
            <a href=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/index_eng.asp>NSERC</a>
            or <a href=http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/bourses/index.htm>FRQNT</a>
            scholarships. Additional scholarships are also available, based on
            academic merit. See the the McGill Fellowships and Awards pages for
            <a href=http://www.mcgill.ca/gps/students/fellowships>graduate
              students</a> and
            <a href=http://www.mcgill.ca/gps/postdocs/fellowships>Postdocs</a>.
            All incoming Ph.D. students are also eligible for the
            <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda>McGill
              Engineering Doctoral Award</a> (MEDA), which is determined largely by
            excellence of your academic and research record.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ph.D. students may receive
            <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/funding/international-student-postdoctoral-funding-opportunities/dfw>differential
              fee waivers</a>, which reduce international tuition to the equivalent
            of Canadian fees. Graduate students may also obtain some financial
            support by working a limited number of hours as Teaching
            Assistants. Further information is available from the ECE
            <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/graduate/fees>Graduate Studies Fees
              and Expenses</a> page.

      <li>
        How do I choose a <a href="#" onclick="$('#thesis_project').slideToggle('slow');return false">thesis
          project</a>?

        <div id="thesis_project" style="display:none">
          <p>
            There are generally a number of reasonably well defined projects in
            my lab that are directly suitable for an M.Sc. or Ph.D. thesis.
            However, I encourage students to spend (at least part of) their first
            semester working on a few small projects in parallel to help decide
            what fits best with their interests.</p>
        </div>
      </li>



      <li>
        What <a href="#" onclick="$('#courses').slideToggle('slow');return false">courses</a> should I take as a
        graduate student in your group?

        <div id="courses" style="display:none">
          <p>
            In ECE, M.Sc. students take 18 graduate credits, typically equivalent to 6 courses. (For
            Ph.D. students, course work, if any, is determined in consultation
            with your thesis committee.) <b>Students should discuss their intended course selections with me, and must
              obtain prior supervisory approval
              if they wish to register for more than 6 credits of non-departmental courses.</b> In general, most
            students in my group
            register for several courses from the following list, unless they have already taken equivalent
            graduate-level courses:</p>

          <ul>
            <li> ECSE 512: Digital Signal Processing I
            <li> ECSE 529: Computer and Biological Vision or COMP 558: Fundamentals of Computer Vision
            <li> COMP 646: Computational Perception
            <li> <a href=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/hci>ECSE 542</a>: Human-Computer Interaction
          </ul>

          <p>
            However, that list should not be taken as a rule, apart from the Human-Computer Interaction course, which I
            consider pretty much mandatory for any member of our group, who has not already taken an equivalent course.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the specific area(s) that your graduate research
            project(s) involve, you might consider specialized courses that
            provide relevant background in such areas as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li> COMP 535: Computer Networks
            <li> MUMT 620: Gestural Control of Sound Synthesis
            <li> MATH 523: Generalized Linear Models
            <li> COMP 557: Fundamentals of Computer Graphics
            <li> <a href=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/ai>ECSE 526</a>: Artificial Intelligence
            <li> COMP 521: Modern Computer Games
            <li> COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
            <li> GLIS 629: Information Security
          </ul>

          <p>
            Students with a leaning toward audio applications may also consider:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li> MUMT 619: Input Devices for Musical Expression
            <li> MUMT 621: Music Information, Retrieval, Acquisition, Preservation
            <li> MUMT 622: Time-Frequency and Parametric Representations of Sounds
          </ul>

          <p>
            There are no hard-and-fast rules for how to split your course load
            between semesters. Some students try to get as many courses as
            possible out of the way early in their studies so that they can
            concentrate on thesis research later; others spread the load more
            evenly over three or four semesters. Regardless, the trick is often
            dealing with scheduling constraints, as most courses are offered only once per year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that you're unlikely able to manage more than 3 courses in any one semester,
            in particular as you'll be expected to begin some preliminary thesis
            research shortly after the start of your studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep in mind that if you're having a hard time choosing between
            several potentially interesting options, you can always start with
            extra courses to try them out for the first couple of weeks, and
            then withdraw from any of them without penalty as long as you do so
            before the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/importantdates/key-dates">add/drop deadline</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're a new M.Sc. student joining my group, you should consult
            the listing of graduate courses being offered for the coming year and
            make tentative selections before arriving at McGill. You can revise
            this during the "course add/drop" period in the first few weeks of the
            term, in consultation with your supervisor. Further information
            regarding the
            <a href=http://www.mcgill.ca/ece/graduate/programinfo>program
              regulations</a> is available from the department web site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Students must also register each semester for "thesis research" courses, which are simply placeholders to
            ensure you have enough credits to maintain full-time status.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>For new graduate students whose first language is not English,</b>
            I strongly recommend you taking one of
            the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/graphos/courses">technical writing
              courses</a> offered by the university. Previous students have found
            these courses immensely valuable, in particular when it comes to help
            in composing research papers and theses.

        Is there funding for me <a href="#" onclick="$('#conferences').slideToggle('slow');return false">to attend
          conferences?</a>

        <div id="conferences" style="display:none">
          <p>If you have an accepted first-authored archival paper in a top-tier (or close-to-top-tier) venue in your
            research area, resulting from work you've carried out in the lab, I will make sure to support your travel
            and registration expenses to present the work at the conference. Students can typically expect to have all
            reasonable expenses covered in such instances, provided that you make efforts to keep these modest, e.g.,
            sharing hotel costs with another student, and applying for travel funding from sources such as the <a
              href="https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/funding/fac-staff/awards/great">GREAT award</a> or (for CIRMMT students)
            the <a href="https://www.cirmmt.org/research/support/travel">CIRMMT Travel Award</a>. For conferences that
            are local or for which the expenses to attend are otherwise significantly reduced, we can discuss
            exceptions, but in general, I expect you to be attending conferences because you are publishing in the
            associated venue.

            f you have strong marks, an interest in the research areas of my
            group, and an ability to learn the necessary tools quickly, I would be
            happy to consider you. Please see the description of our ongoing and
            past <a href=../projects />research projects</a> as many of these have
            sub-topics that are well-suited for advanced undergraduate
            students.</p>

          <p>
            Once you have a sense of the project(s) that interest you, please send me a brief note, with the word
            UNDERGRAD in the subject line, explaining why you think you or your project group are a good fit, and attach
            your CV(s). That way, I'll have a better sense of your interests and background to begin the conversation
            before you finalize your choice. If you are applying for one of my posted capstone projects but don't yet
            have a team, please let me know, and I'll try to put you in contact with other students with similar
            interests.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you undertake a project in my lab, expect to work hard, and to be
            pro-active in keeping me informed of your progress on a regular basis.
            As Josh Redel (2012-2013 president of SSMU, the Student Society of
            McGill University) noted, "To be perfectly honest, I asked you to be
            my supervisor because I knew you would be critical... I knew you would
            provide more of a challenge..." If you're looking for an easy "A",
            please consider working with another professor.</p>

        Can I apply for an <a href="#" onclick="$('#intern').slideToggle('slow');return false">undergraduate research

        <div id="intern" style="display:none">
          <p>
            We accept a number of research intern students each year, often for
            the summer months, but in general, <b>cannot offer any funding</b>
            unless you qualify for an
            <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp">NSERC

            McGill's <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/sure">Summer

            <a href=http://www.mitacs.ca/globalink/globalink-research-internship>MITACS
              Globalink internship</a>. Students from outside McGill who do not
            meet these criteria can apply as undergraduate research trainees
            through the procedures
            described <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/students/records/trainees">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, it is helpful to <a href=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/email>contact me</a> in advance,
            summarizing your interests in an internship, and including a CV describing your relevant experience.

        <div id="international" style="display:none">

            If you have strong marks and have identified a research interest
            that is closely aligned with current <a href=../projects>Shared Reality Lab
              activities</a>, I would be happy to discuss your application as a

        I'm applying for grad school or a job opportunity.

        <a href="#" onclick="$('#reflet').slideToggle('slow');return false">Can you provide a reference letter for
          me?</a>

        <div id="reflet" style="display:none">
          <p>
            Obtaining reference letters from your professors and supervisors is often an essential requirement for the
            next step of your career. However, a mediocre reference letter ("The applicant took my class and obtained a
            passing grade." or "I supervised this student's capstone project and they submitted their portion of the
            final report.") is likely to be less helpful than having no letter at all. Writing a good reference letter
            can easily take 1-3 hours. If you're intending to ask me at some point to provide such a reference for you,
            keep in mind that in order for me to justify the time investment, I need to know your work well enough, and
            be sufficiently impressed with your achievements. If so, the results can speak for themselves:

                I've come to the end of the application process, and wanted to reach out to give a huge thank you for
                your support. I'm extremely excited to be starting my PhD with Stanford Bioengineering this Fall.
              </p>
              <p>
                The psychosis project has been one of my favorite research experiences, and one that I took every
                opportunity to discuss throughout my grad school interviews. I'm so grateful I had the chance to work on
                it. More generally, the SRL has a culture that's really special &mdash; high-energy, passionate, and
                conscientious. This has helped me understand the energy and tone I want in the research group I
                eventually join, which is invaluable.
              </p>
              <p>
                So thank you again, for your support, and for the opportunity you gave me. I hope I'll get to cross
                paths with you and other SRL lab members many more times in the future.
              </p>

                I actually heard yesterday that I've also been selected for the Fulbright award! There's still some
                final steps (i.e. approval from Fulbright board), but I officially made it through the selection
                process. It's hard to believe that things have worked out so well for me &mdash; I must have had some
                strong recommenders.
