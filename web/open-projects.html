    <b>The GoldenEye randomizer</b> is an innovative mod that transforms
    the game into a
    refreshingly dynamic experience by scattering items across levels; imagine a circuit board on Silo placed somewhere
    on Dam.
    In this
    proposed mod,
    three random
    levels are unlocked at the very beginning of the game, one of which is Dam, and two others selected at
    random that are spaced a
    few levels apart
    in the game
    (e.g., Dam, B2, and Caverns). The goal would be to unlock and complete
    all 20 levels, but key items needed to progress past parts of a level are placed in random locations on other
    levels. For example, in this "Dam/B2/Caverns" selection, the keycard at the start on Facility
    could be placed somewhere on Caverns, so the player would not be able to beat Facility immediately after Dam, but
    rather
    have
    to play Caverns, find the "Facility keycard" in the level, and then revisit Facility (items would carry
    over across levels). Then, for example, the ignition key on Runway or large key on S1 could be located somewhere in
    Statue, so players would be required to explore the "post-B2" set of levels to complete Runway/S1. Such style of
    randomization
    could be designed in a way to require completing levels in unusual orders, revisiting levels multiple times,
    and exploring regions of levels not typically encountered during gameplay/speedruns. For added unpredictability, the
    mod would also shuffle guard weapons, guard health, body armor positions, alarm/camera positions, or even
    mirror levels. Logic would have
    to be designed to make any combination of logic possible such that players do not get softlocked.

    <p>
      This project would involve the following positions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing the logic of the randomizer;</li>
      <li>Creating a ROM hack that implements such logic;</li>
      <li>Playtesting the ROM hack to ensure it is playable.</li>
      <li>Exploring the possibility of a similar style of randomizer for Perfect Dark, especially since a PC port for
        that game is currently available.</li>

      <b> Train Agent Zero Kill Challenge </b>



    </p>
    <p>Completing Train Agent with zero kills is an interesting challenge due to the dense presence of guards
      in several narrow corridors, and added complexity in taking out the locks at the end. As you cannot kill Ouromov,
      you must take out the locks at near-WR pace while avoiding hits
      from the two nearby ZMG guards who open the door. Unfortunately, when
      skipping guards at the
      beginning, the locked door to Ouromov takes
      several minutes to open. Understanding the reason behind the slow door opening, or finding a way to manipulate it,
      would enhance the enjoyment of the challenge.

      <b> Improving the B2 00A WR Console Lure</b>

      <br>

    <p>
      <!-- The "TAS clipboard" lure employed in the current Bunker 2 00 Agent 0:49 World Record run presents a potential
      time-saving opportunity of up to 2 seconds. However, a significant obstacle associated with this tactic is the
      presence of a group of guards near the third-to-last camera area. This complicates the task of obtaining both the
      clipboard and successfully hitting the fourth camera, as the auto-aim functionality tends to target the guards.
      Consequently, maintaining consistency in completing runs becomes challenging.

      To address this issue, the WR run incorporates a dual-weapon switch attempt to fire more ammunition
      simultaneously. Unfortunately, this strategy proves ineffective, as the auto-aim system still locks onto the
      nearby guards. Understanding the origin of these guards and finding a way to redirect their movement could
      potentially enhance the viability of the strategy. Given that it's easier to predict the identity of the clipboard
      guard, improving consistency in dealing with the fourth camera could significantly enhance the overall feasibility
      of the approach.

      Furthermore, variability in the positioning of the safe key guard adds an additional layer of complexity to the
      level. The guard can be found either at the junction door, beside the documents room door, or sometimes multiple
      guards occupy the corridor. Analyzing and deciphering these guard patterns could lead to a substantial improvement
      in the ease of executing the level and contribute to bringing the World Record time down to its optimal potential. -->

      The "TAS clipboard" lure used in the current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0LH9eSInhM">Bunker 2 00
        Agent 0:49
        World Record run</a> can save up to 2 seconds, but a
      significant problem associated with this strategy is a pile-up of guards near the 3rd last camera area.
      This makes it very difficult to hit the camera, since the autoaim tries to target nearby guards instead. To
      address this issue,
      the WR run
      uses a dual-weapon wielding trick to kill the guards in an attempt to "release" the autoaim quickly enough for the
      camera, but
      the trick remains ineffective as it is usually difficult to kill the offending guards fast enough. A better
      approach is to
      understand the
      path of these guards, and try to redirect their movement. This could significantly improve the consistency of this
      section of the level.
      A secondary, minor issue is the randomness in the position of the second safe key guard, i.e., the guard lured
      from the dossier room. The
      guard is easiest to
      kill when he is at the far end of the corridor just before the stairs, but he can be found in multiple positions:
      in front of the junction door, beside the documents room door, and sometimes alongside a clone before the stairs.
      What causes these random positions?
      Understanding both of these lures better could help lower the WR time.

      <b>Rescue PA's Shower Door Problem</b>

      <br>
    </p>
    <p>Take a look at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Kia7s6qK4">Rescue Perfect Agent 2:34</a>. I reach
      the shower room door at low-mid 1:20ish, which is standard pace to this part of the level. Both shower doors
      seem to open really slow at this pace, costing as much as 6 seconds, likely because the patrolling guard who opens
      it
      after being alerted is at the far
      end of the shower room. This "late door open" happens frequently, and will unfortunately be in the way of Rescue
      PA
      having a time in the low 2:20s. It may be worth doing Objective One (console room lure), Objective Two (X-Ray),
      and the
      keycard lure in a different order (even after the shower room door lure) such that you reach the shower door when
      the guard is nearby. Such combinations of strats need to be investigated to see whether they improve consistency
      of the
      level, particularly by affecting the shower guard's position, and may include:


    <ul>
      <li>Watching more cinema to have the first lift shut on you;</li>
      <li>Doing the X-Ray objective after the keycard lure (as opposed to doing it at the very end);</li>
      <li>Manually doing the Objective One uplink to mitigate one major luck factor in the level;</li>
      <li>Doing the Objective One lure after the shower door lure.</li>

      <b>Improved Consistency & Practice For the Fast G5 Door Lure</b>

      <br>
    </p>
    <p>The G5 Building Special Agent World Record still uses the slower guard lure after the 2nd room. The faster lure,
      as seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lRDUMlYwUs">Agent 0:32</a>,
      can be a second faster, and is the key to lowering the Special Agent record to 0:35. Though the
      faster guard lure appears to be inconsistent, I have seen and personally encountered
      several successful attempts in a short span, indicating that there may be a trick™ to improve its
      consistency, such as punching the guard at a particular angle and/or after a particular amount of time, which
      needs to be
      investigated. Secondly, the
      faster lure
      results in the player reaching subsequent rooms much quicker, where patrolling guards are in "earlier" positions
      that are more
      awkward to handle, e.g., the patrolling guard in the buttons room is on the left side of the room, which means he
      must be killed <i>after</i> deactivating the buttons on the right side of the room.
      As it can take a long time to play out real runs to deal with these guard positions, a ROM in which the guard runs
      to and
      opens the door every try would help significantly with practice, and also be effective in determining whether
      there would be any increase in lag at the end of the level (post-cinema).

      <b>Runway 00 Agent Ultimate Practice ROM</b>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Runway 00 Agent World Record strategy has a steep learning curve, which could be significantly flattened with
      a well-designed
      practice ROM. Currently, it is difficult to know where to stand for each R-lean throw, and this difficulty can be
      compounded if the player struggles
      with R-leaning in general. Such a ROM would mark positions on the map for each throw, and have a single
      button that
      mimics an R-lean, such that
      players can learn each of these factors separately. Extra features could include statistics that
      show how close each
      throw is to its target.</p>

    <p> An eye-tracker that lets viewers see where the player is looking during gameplay, such as
      a transparent moving bubble that corresponds to the player's gaze, could provide useful insight into a
      player's style of play that isn't typically noticed (how often do they look at their ammo? when do they look at
      the
      timer [in PD]? how quickly do they notice black-hat guards in their peripheral view during the Control protect?
      etc.) It might be possible to get something semi-robust working with just a good quality webcam or an Inertial

      <b>Measuring Controller Action Per Level</b>

      A natural curiosity arises as to what levels require the most action, which can be measured by the amount of stick
      movement
      or frequency of button presses throughout a typical attempt of a level. Firmware that detects controller inputs
      already exist,
      so this project would only require tracking level attempts, and logging data on the stick movement and button
      presses. These
      data can then
      be compiled, analyzed, and then presented in a way to show which levels have the most action. </p>

      <b>Faster Investigation Perfect Agent Zoom Strats</b>

    <p>AceCorp is seeking individuals interested in problem-solving to help engineer an alternative, quicker, and more
      fun-to-play WR strategy for Investigation PA. Prerequisites include knowledge of both the Investigation SA & PA WR
      strats; understanding how guards are lured in GoldenEye or Perfect Dark is an asset.

      The current WR on Investigation Perfect Agent involves a "blind bot zoom", an off-screen zoom that requires
      guesstimating to time correctly. Additionally, with the standard WR route, the player can complete objectives and
      reach the lasers much faster than the bot by several seconds, so time is wasted sandbagging, e.g, Clemens' 2:26
      kills guards in the first experiment room when he can ignore these guards and directly activate the terminals
      instead. Considering there are alternative/additional locations the bot can be zoomed to make it reach the lasers
      faster, strats such as directly activating the terminals should be used in conjunction with these alternative bot
      zooms instead.

      Our 2:25 fail shows that performing the hallway zoom instead of the "blind bot zoom", similar to the SA route, can
      result in quicker bot paces than the current WR strat. The hallway zoom is much easier to time because the player
      can see when the bot enters the hallway, thus removing the need to guesstimate. We also perform a zoom immediately
      after activating the bot, which saves approximately 2-3 seconds. Additionally, because we are at the far end of
      the hallway when the bot is just entering it, we will have time to zoom the bot at the first set of lasers, saving
      another two seconds. This could result in a 1:39-1:42 uplink, which is 2 to 5 seconds faster than Clemens’ 2:26.

      With our route, we directly activate the terminals in the first console room, but because we are so fast in doing
      so, the K7 guard isn’t lured outside his room after shutting down the experiment. To address this problem, we
      attempt to lure the K7 guard all the way to the end of the hallway instead, after the final two experiments, as
      shown in this Clemens video from five years ago. However, this K7 lure appears to be inconsistent. Your role is to
      find The Trick™ to lure the guard to the end of the hallway more often. We are also considering another strategy
      that involves going inside the K7 room after the first experiment to kill the guard so he does not become a
      concern later. Unfortunately, because he is still deep inside the room, as shown in the previously linked video,
      this takes several extra seconds, so making it back to the hallway corridor after grabbing the Night Vision to
      time the zoom becomes extremely tight. A workaround is to skip the zoom immediately after activating the bot,
      which would also make it easier for the K7 guard to make the lift cycle, but this results in a 2-3 second
      timeloss. A better approach would be to see whether the guard can at least be lured closer to the room's entrance
      on the way back from the first experiment, but this too requires finding The Trick.™, which you must figure out.
      Additional tasks, though not mandatory, can be finding small timesavers to make our alternative route easier to
      run.

      <b>Reliable Infiltration PA RTA Strategy</b>

      <br>
    <p>
      The out-of-bounds (OoB) warp on Infiltration is a one-shot risky strategy that requires precise weapon-switch
      timing, and failing the clip on an RTA run is
      effectively the death of the run,
      as you will otherwise be quickly killed by the two high-accuracy MagSec guards, or have
      little time
      for a subsequent attempt. Yet, the
      OoB clip saves
      over thirty seconds compared to traditional RTA strategies, and makes survival for the hangar segment trivial. Is
      there a way to make the OoB clip easier to
      perform, or are there any alternative OoB positions that could save a similar amount of time?

      <b>Frigate 00 Agent Consistent Strategy</b>

      <br>
    <p>
      The current WR strategy for Frigate 00 Agent has incredibly poor hostage completion odds, primarily caused by
      reliance on the
      "00A hostage"
      whose odds of escaping at WR speed are extremely low. The "engine room" strategy, used on <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujAhybvkkug">my 1:08</a>, <a
        href="https://forums.the-elite.net/index.php?msg=482469">significantly improves hostage escape odds</a>, but
      demands
      exceptionally
      fast movement to match or surpass WR pace. Yet, this tradeoff may be worth considering, especially as a more
      skill-based
      challenge. Exploring alternative strategies, such as incorporating the reverse
      pipe warp route at the beginning, and documenting their odds, may also warrant investigation.</p>

      <b>WAR! Agent 0:24 tricks</b>

      <br>
    <p>
      As early as 2005, I theorized the possibility of performing more Phoenix boosts on WAR Agent to make 0:24 viable,
      using this
      technique to
      get door TTs almost a second faster than Karl's 0:25, though without grabbing a Mauler, which is required for the
      King shot.
      However, boosts can be ineffective in short corridors, hard to perform in the corridor with "stretching walls",
      and
      the
      randommness of Skedar
      spawns makes finding an optimal spot to find a Mauler tricky. What combination of boosts and
      obtaining a Mauler could make for a straightforward 0:24 strategy that one could commit to?</p>

<b>Two-arm wearable vibrotactile flow display</b>

<br />
Vibrotactile flow refers to a continuously moving sensation of vibrotactile stimulation applied by a few actuators directly onto the skin or through a rigid medium. The perceptual basis of vibrotactile flow can be traced back to the well-known tactile illusions of <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03205902">apparent tactile motion</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4081935">phantom sensation</a>. When the skin is directly stimulated by two separate vibrotactile actuators, a single vibrotactile sensation can be elicited midway between the two stimulation points. The position of the sensation can be moved between the two stimulation points by controlling the intensities of the two stimuli (amplitude inhibition) or the time gap between the stimuli (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4081935">temporal inhibition</a>). Various forms and location of the effects have been developed: in 1-D space (linear movement), 2-D (moving sensation on a plane), and even out-of-body (e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173832">from left to right hand</a> through the air).

<p>
The students will design a bimanual wearable haptic display that contains an array of vibrotactile actuators that can be controlled independently. The intended form factor is a pair of stretchable gloves and sleeves, which contain multiple vibrotactile actuators for the wearable of each hand/arm.

<p>
This project is suitable for a team with basic mechatronics control experience and interest in applications of vibrotactile flows.  Further interest in conducting a perception study would be a plus.

<p>
Resources:  The students will be provided with the necessary haptic actuators and interface circuitry; hardware needed for integrating these into wearables will be purchased as necessary.

<b>Multimodal haptic armrest</b>

<br />
This project investigates simultaneous delivery of haptic stimuli from a heterogeneous set of actuators, embedded in an armrest, in order to generate rich and immersive feedback during a user's engagement with a visual display, e.g., during movie-watching, gaming, or video-based sports training.  The target haptic actuation methods include conventional vibrotactile, force-feedback (push-pull impact or gripping), thermal, and pneumatic. These could be exploited, for example, during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3f1Tvev010&feature=youtu.be&t=27">falling into the pit</a> scene in Jumanji by having the armrest convey physical sensations appropriate to the experience of gripping and tumbling, and rapidly reduce the delivered temperature, in order to augment the immersive nature of the viewing experience. The students will design a prototype armrest that embeds several independently controlled haptic interfaces to realize these objectives.

<p>
This project is suitable for a team with basic mechatronics control experience and electronics knowledge as necessary to design the driving circuit for the actuators. Ideal candidates will also have some coding skill and academic curiosity to learn more about haptics.

<b>Comparing Power Efficiency of Haptic Rendering Mechanisms</b>

<br />
Haptic effects are increasingly used in consumer products, whether to deliver notifications of incoming messages, communicate information to deaf-blind individuals through their hands, or enrich videogame experiences.  To produce these effects, various actuation technologies have been developed, including eccentric rotating mass, linear resonant actuators, and piezoelectric membranes, among others.  Despite extensive use of these devices in consumer technologies, there has been surprisingly little in the way of investigation and comparison of their power consumption, and how power relates to the perceived intensity of the stimuli they provide.  Complicating matters, such perception is dependent on frequency of the stimuli, the body location where the stimuli are delivered, and the size of the contact area.  The objective of this project is to develop a procedure and testbench that allows for such comparisons to be made, carry out a preliminary such test procedure, and publish the results as a valuable resource to the haptics community.

<p>
The student should be experienced in mechanical design as relevant to the test platform, and interested in experimental studies to characterize objective and perceptual measures of haptic devices.

<b>Skin-coupling of wearable devices and its impact on information exchange</b>

<br />
How firmly a wearable device, such as a smartwatch, is coupled to the body can change how its haptic effects are perceived and its ability to measure physiological signals. However, researchers and wearable-makers often rely on vague subjective coupling characteristics such as "strapped snugly" or "tight yet comfortable". Achieving consistent strap tightness across body sites and between users can be challenging, since even if strap tension is consistent, differences in limb circumference alter the resulting normal force under the wearable system in potentially unintuitive ways. Furthermore, when users must attach the devices, they may not use the same tightness each day. We have developed a system that aims to assist people in putting wearable devices on their body in a consistent manner.

<p>
This project involves the design and implementation of an experiment and its technical framework to conduct a simple characterization of the system's properties,
carry out a user study evaluating the practical influence of the system on the user's ability to achieve more consistent skin coupling characteristics and the influence this has on haptic communication and physiological sensing efficacy, and 
participate in the submission of an academic paper, which will include literature review, writing, and editing activities.

<p>
Deliverables include:
<ul>
  <li> Characterization of the system's properties</li>
  <li> Technical infrastructure for running a user study</li>
  <li> Analysis of results from a user study evaluating the practical influence of the system on the user's ability to achieve more consistent skin coupling characteristics and the influence this has on haptic communication and physiological sensing efficacy</li>
  <li> Publication submission reporting on the characterization of the system's properties and results from the user study</li>

This project is suitable for highly motivated and autonomous students
from Mechanical, or Electrical and Computer Engineering. The ideal
candidates would be familiar with or have interests in the design and
execution of a user study and strong 3D CAD modelling skills.

Resources: The candidates will work from their personal computers.
If they have access to a 3D printer, the laboratory will reimburse
filament. Alternatively, university infrastructure will be used to 3D

<b>3D Printed Tactile Illusions Design and Evaluation</b>

<br />
Appreciating a sensory illusion often requires you to experience it with your own senses. While this is generally trivial for visual and auditory illusions that can be rendered using commonly available hardware, haptic illusions often require complex mechanical systems. Vincent Hayward's, <a href="http://cim.mcgill.ca/~haptic/pub/VH-BRB-08.pdf">A brief taxonomy of tactile illusions and demonstrations that can be done in a hardware store</a> introduced simple and affordable DIY assemblies to make haptic illusions more accessible. However, we argue that the skills and materials required to fabricate the illusions he describes are often non-trivial, thereby depriving the paper's intended audience from experiencing and learning about these haptic illusions.
Our research group has already created a set of 3D printed tactile illusions. This project involves the refinement of our existing models to strengthen illusion robustness, and the modelling of new 3D printed illusions drawn from the literature. An evaluation and validation of the robustness of the illusions will be carried out through a user study. The candidate may be asked to participate in the submission of an academic paper, which will include literature review, writing, and editing activities.

<b>Variable Friction Shoe Device for VR, gaming, training, and rehabilitation</b>
<br />

<p>
We are exploring the use of shoe-based mechanisms to dynamically modulate the friction characteristics during foot-ground contact for applications in rehabilitation, virtual reality, and gaming experiences. The intent is to induce, under external control, the experience of unexpectedly encountering a slippery surface, such as ice, to simulate natural walking conditions in potentially hazardous conditions.

<p>
This project involves design, specification, prototyping and testing of a robust, third-generation variable-friction mechanism for installation in an athletic shoe that can provide these capabilities.
The device must operate effectively during regular walking activity in everyday environments, without sustaining damage. A controller will be necessary to operate the mechanism such that it responds reasonably rapidly to an instruction to transition from a high-friction to low-friction setting, and vice versa.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957415817301034">Previous iterations</a> explored for this capability range from the use of teflon materials, various rolling mechanisms, including an array of tightly packed ball-transfer units, and one involving expulsion of air through a flexible skirt surrounding the shoe.
After refining the mechanism, our intent is to carry out experiments to verify whether such artificially induced slips exhibit similar biomechanical properties to real-world slip events, and ultimately, incorporate such hardware into rehabilitation and training environments.

<p>
This project could be carried out by 2-4 members with strong mechanical design experience, ideally with a mechatronics background.

<p>
Resources: The necessary hardware components required for development of the mechanism will be purchased for the group, but access to machining resources will have to be discussed with the relevant university's lab managers.
